# Three Sum Problem

This project provides a solution to the *Three Sum Problem*, where the objective is to find all unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find all unique triplets in the array that sum to zero. The output should be a list of triplets, where each triplet is an array of three integers that add up to zero.

### Example

```python
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
result = three_sum(nums)
print(result)
