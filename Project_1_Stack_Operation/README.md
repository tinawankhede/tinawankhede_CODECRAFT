# Reverse a Stack

This project implements a simple algorithm to reverse the order of elements in a stack using only basic stack operations (push and pop) and recursion, without using any additional data structures.

## Problem Statement

Given a stack of integers, the task is to reverse the order of elements in the stack.

### Example

```python
stack = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reverse_stack(stack)
print(stack)
